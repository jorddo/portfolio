          I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like aâ€¦ she's the
          belle of the ball! Whoa whoa whoa whoa. Wait. Are you telling me you
          have a multi-stage trick with hidden identities? Te quiero. English,
          please. I love you! Great, now I'm late. Boy, I sure feel like a Mary
          without a Peter and a Paul. And THAT'S why you always leave a note.
          Michael, you are not quite the ladies man I had pictured. Hopefully,
          we will remedy that when we are in the spa spreading body chocolate on
          each other. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is
          she running the lights or something?
